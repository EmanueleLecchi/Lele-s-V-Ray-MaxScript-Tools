Markov-chain like temporal smoothing:

have the "history of evidence" be the Multiplier average of the past 5 frames.
Have the current Multiplier as the current state.

Subtract the past history from the current state, algebraically sum the result to the current state to infer the forward P. (tendency line)

Validate next frame results based around a P threshold, blending with it as needed over time (the past history ought to allow for "adaptation", even through incremental blending. Speed of adaptation ought to be studied.).
